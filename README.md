# poePart1
This Part of the entire poe challenged us to make use of multiple arrays in order to save multiple ingrediants (with quantities and units of measure) and steps in order to make up an entire recipe. Furthermore, we were challenged to scale and reset the entire recipe as well as clear the whole recipe for a new one to be added.
